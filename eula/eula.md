## LAST SEEN ONLINE END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT

### SUMMARY

This End User License Agreement (EULA) tells you how you can use Last Seen Online. We try to protect streamers or let’s play and allow them to monetize off of playing the game. We also love fan-content and fan-art and want our players to create more. We’re trying to protect ourselves from people taking our assets and using it in their own disingenuous product – whether to make a clone of the game or to use images, sounds, music in something that has very little to do with Last Seen Online.

So – this EULA talks about your license to play the game, what you can and can't do, the fan-content you make, who owns the game, changes, warranty stuff, and how we sort out disagreements. By jumping into Last Seen Online, you’re agreeing to all of this.

### 1. INTRODUCTION

THIS AGREEMENT IS A LEGAL CONTRACT BETWEEN YOU AND SOCHIN STUDIO LLC. PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY.

By downloading, installing, and/or using Last Seen Online (the "Game"), you are confirming your acceptance of this End User License Agreement (the "Agreement").

### 3. RESTRICTIONS

You agree not to exploit the Game or any of its parts commercially, including, but not limited to, by transferring, selling, renting, sub-licensing, or distributing the Game or creating derivative works based on the Game. You may not reverse engineer, derive source code, modify, decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works of the Game, in whole or in part.

### 4. USER CONTENT

You are granted permission to generate and share screenshots, video content, fan art, and in-game sounds or music derived from the Game for purposes of fan content, including but not limited to "let's play" videos, blogs, journals, vlogs, podcasts, live streams, social media posts, fan websites, or any other forms of media discussing the Game. However, you may not use any assets, including but not limited to images, sounds, or any other elements pertaining to the game, in your own software or game, commercial or otherwise, unless it is explicitly a non-monetized fan game. Any unauthorized use, reproduction, distribution, modification, display, or performance of our assets is strictly prohibited and constitutes a violation of this Agreement. This restriction is applicable even if you derive no commercial advantage or monetary gain from the unauthorized use. Please note that you are allowed to monetize your content strictly within the context of video streaming, video uploads, and on your own websites featuring screenshots or videos. This means that you can derive income from your content, for instance, through advertising revenue generated from views on your videos or visits to your website.

### 9. SUBJECT TO CHANGE
