sochin means **number 9 **in Vietnamese. It also means **preserve the peace** in Japanese. It’s a form of karate. It’s the number of letters in my first and last name. The Beatles released a song called **Revolution No. 9** where the lyrics repeat “Number Nine” over and over again, which inspired **Takahiro Miyashata** to create a fashion brand named Number (N)ine. When you multiply any number by 9, then add the digits up until it becomes a single digit number, you always get 9. Most importantly, the SEO for this name is pretty good for a short name.

The name is mostly meaningless, so you can fill it with whatever meaning you want. Choose whatever from the above feels best for you. In a way, (here’s the deep part) it’s a lot like life: empty, meaningless, maybe has some of the past slightly attached – but every day is a new day and you will always have an opportunity to write your own meaning.
