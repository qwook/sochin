            <h2>LAST SEEN ONLINE END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT</h2>
<h3>SUMMARY</h3>
<p>This End User License Agreement (EULA) is all about the rules of the game for using Last Seen Online.

By jumping into Last Seen Online, you’re agreeing to all of this.</p>

<p>You agree not to exploit the Game or any of its parts commercially, including, but not limited to, by transferring, selling, renting, sub-licensing, or distributing the Game or creating derivative works based on the Game. You may not reverse engineer, derive source code, modify, decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works of the Game, in whole or in part.</p>
<h3>4. USER CONTENT</h3>

However, you may not use any assets, including but not limited to images, sounds, or any other elements pertaining to the game, in your own software or game, commercial or otherwise, unless it is explicitly a non-monetized fan game. Any unauthorized use, reproduction, distribution, modification, display, or performance of our assets is strictly prohibited and constitutes a violation of this Agreement. This restriction is applicable even if you derive no commercial advantage or monetary gain from the unauthorized use. Please note that you are allowed to monetize your content strictly within the context of video streaming, video uploads, and on your own websites featuring screenshots or videos.
