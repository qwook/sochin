Here at **sochin**, we believe that great games come from tiny teams with strong direction, this means that one person should own at least 80% of the game – from coding, to writing, sound design, and game design.

We are currently not hiring because this studio is just Henry and Henry can’t afford to pay anyone, but if you reach out then Henry might help you build, release, and publish your game. Henry can also help you publish games through this LLC where he won’t take any profit, if the game fits the values of Sochin. IDK, still figuring this whole LLC thing out.
